            <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 
                        baking sheet.</li>
                    <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir sausage 
                        in the hot skillet until cooked through, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and 
                        discard grease.</li>
                    <li>Spread pizza crust dough onto the prepared baking sheet; top with a 
                        layer of nacho cheese sauce. Layer hash brown potatoes evenly over 
                        the nacho cheese layer. Sprinkle chorizo over potatoes.</li>
                    <li>Beat eggs, salsa, and taco seasoning together in a bowl using a whisk 
                        until smooth.</li>
                    <li>Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir egg mixture 
                        until eggs are set and scrambled, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer scrambled 
                        eggs to a plate; allow to cool until easily handled. Sprinkle 
                        scrambled eggs over chorizo layer and top with Mexican cheese 
                        blend.</li>
                    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until crust is golden brown and cheese is 
                        melted and bubbling, 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
