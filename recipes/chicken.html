                <p>Cheesy Bacon Chicken with Mustard Sauce is chicken breasts marinated in 
                    honey mustard sauce and baked topped with bacon and cheese. It is based

            <h2>Steps</h2>
                <h3>Marinade</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>In a medium bowl, combine mustard, honey, oil, lemon juice, salt,
                             and pepper. Using a fork or small whisk, mix for about 30 seconds
                              or until all ingredients are well combined. This will make about
                               1 cup of marinade.</li>
                        <li>Place chicken breasts in a sealable plastic bag. Pour about 
                            <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> cup of the marinade over the chicken, 
                            making sure all the chicken has been coated. Seal the bag and 
                            place the chicken into the refrigerator for at least 2 hours.</li>
                        <li>Store the remaining <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> cup marinade in the 
                            refrigerator to brush on later.</li>
                    </ol>
                <h3>Chicken</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>When ready, preheat the oven to 375°F.</li>
                        <li>To a large oven-safe skillet over medium-high heat, add oil. When 
                            the oil is hot, sear the chicken in the pan for 3-4 minutes per 
                            side, or until golden brown. (The chicken will not be fully 
                            cooked at this point; it will cook more in the oven.)</li>
                        <li>Remove the skillet from the heat. Brush the tops of each seared 
                            chicken breast with a little of the reserved honey mustard 
                            marinade, saving the rest to serve on the side later.</li>
                        <li>Top each chicken breast with 2 slices of cooked bacon. Then, add 
                            <sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> cup of each kind of shredded cheese to 
                            each chicken breast.</li>
                        <li>Bake the chicken for 8-10 minutes, or until the chicken is fully 
                            cooked and reaches an internal temperature of 165°F.</li>
                        <li>Serve chicken garnished with parsley and the extra honey mustard 
                            marinade.</li>
                    </ol>
