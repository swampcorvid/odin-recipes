            <h2>Description</h2>          
                <p>Most home bakers don’t give a second thought to whipping up a pan of fudgy 
                    brownies or a batch of classic cookies. But there’s one bake that often 
                    gives even seasoned bakers some pause: a homemade bread recipe.</p>
                <p>Maybe it’s the yeast (it can be tricky!) or all the kneading and waiting
                    that puts some off this bake. But don’t shy away from making bread! Once 
                    you master bread-making basics, it’s such a joy to bake—and who doesn’t 
                    love the smell of freshly baked bread?</p>

            <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 package (<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> ounce) active dry yeast</li>
                    <li>3 tablespoons plus <sup>1</sup>>/<sub>2</sub> teaspoon sugar</li>
                    <li>2-<sup>1</sup>>/<sub>4</sub> cups warm water (110° to 115°)</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
                    <li>6-<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> to 6-<sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> cups bread flour</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons canola oil</li>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>In a large bowl, dissolve yeast and <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> 
                        teaspoon sugar in warm water; let stand until bubbles form on surface. Whisk together salt, 
                        3 cups flour and remaining 3 tablespoons sugar. Stir oil into yeast 
                        mixture; pour into flour mixture and beat until smooth. Stir in 
                        enough remaining flour, <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> cup at a time, to form a soft dough.</li>
                    <li>Turn out onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, 
                        8-10 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease the 
                        top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, 1-<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> to 2 
                        hours.</li>
                    <li>Punch dough down. Turn onto a lightly floured surface; divide dough 
                        in half. Shape each into a loaf. Place in 2 greased 9x5-in. loaf 
                        pans. Cover and let rise until doubled, 1 to 1-<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> hours.</li>
                    <li>Bake at 375° until loaf is golden brown and sounds hollow when tapped 
                        or a thermometer reads 200°, 30-35 minutes. Remove from pans to wire 
                        racks to cool.</li>
