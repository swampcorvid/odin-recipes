        <h2>Description</h2>          
            <p>Most home bakers don’t give a second thought to whipping up a pan of fudgy 
                brownies or a batch of classic cookies. But there’s one bake that often 
                gives even seasoned bakers some pause: a homemade bread recipe.</p>
            <p>Maybe it’s the yeast (it can be tricky!) or all the kneading and waiting
                 that puts some off this bake. But don’t shy away from making bread! Once 
                 you master bread-making basics, it’s such a joy to bake—and who doesn’t 
                 love the smell of freshly baked bread?</p>
